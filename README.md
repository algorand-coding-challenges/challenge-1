# 🎮 Algorand Coding Challenge: Fix The Bug 🐞!

## 🚩 Challenge 1: I Can't Send My Transaction! 😭

> I want to send 1 ALGO to my friend to show how amazing Algorand is but I can't send my transaction! what's wrong???

Inside of `index.ts` file, there is a script that sends a payment transaction that sends 1,000,000 microAlgos (1 ALGO) to the receiver's wallet. However if you try running the `index.ts` file after opening Docker Desktop and then running:
```bash
algokit bootstrap all
algokit localnet start
npm run start
```
it will fail and show this error: `TypeError: Argument must be byte array`

This repository has the `challenge` folder on the root level, which contains the fix the bug challenge codebase.
Find the `index.ts` file inside of the `challenge` folder and **fix the bug! 🐞**
